Changes in this version

- the 'type' parameter, which cast facet values to a given type, is gone
- query execution is delayed until results are wanted
- type specific formatters


KNOWN PROBLEMS.

-- none at the moment


DESIRED FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS.

-- "training-wheels" mode using SQL group statements instead of bitsets
-- migrations using DM facet declarations

-- clean up sql generation in postgres adapter  DONE
-- determine exact memory requirements of postgres scalability example  DONE
-- optimise queries up to 1,000,000 scalability target DONE

-- modify widgets to multiplex ajax calls to work around 2 call limit in many browsers
   [ design: fetch() queues ajax calls; update() implementations request queue and merge current webservice call with
             ones already in the queue.  on controller side, receive multiple facet names, iterate, and bundle.  fetch()
             then unbundles the results can dispatches them to appropriate callbacks ]
